            Dear Maggie,

            Congratulations on the completion of the construction of the new marketing wing of XYZ. I know how much time you put into the plans for the building, and I really appreciate the innovation and attention to detail you brought to the project. We knew you were the right person for the job!

            Thank you so much for your and your staffâ€™s hard work. We look forward to future projects with you.

            Regards,

            Andrew</p>
